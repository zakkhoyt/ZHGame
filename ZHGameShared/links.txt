No problem at all - i've also got around 6 years under my belt. Great to hear all opinions.
To be frank I went with UDP and Cocoa Async because it just worked and was so much easier to implement.
For constant streams like audio progress to power a progress bar it also seemed more appropriate.
Honestly TCP is probably the better option here and I was noticing dire consequences on
dropping a packet (basically a view wouldn't load properly on the next round) so it seems like
I'd end up with a lot more work on the error handling side with UDP anyway.
FYI here's the link that really got me started on the right foot since I'm also using swift:
